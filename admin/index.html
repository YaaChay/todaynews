                    <h4>YouTube Opens More Pathways for Creators to Make Money on the Platform</h4>
                    <p>The video platform will let more creators earn payments and place ads in Shorts, its TikTok
                        competitor,
                        according to audio from an internal meeting.
                        YouTube is expected to announce more opportunities for content creators to earn money on its
                        video
                        service, hoping to guard its role as a home to popular personalities and gain an edge against
                        rival
                        TikTok.</p>
